# Property Settings

# This section defines every metadata property that can be used
# in the system. Individual work types may override some settings
# defined here. Predicates for each property should be defined
# here, and cannot be overridden once defined.

properties:

  # Example only:
  # default:
  #   definition: "This property has not yet been documented."
  #   usage_note: "Multiple instances are allowed, but discouraged. In some contexts it cannot be predicited which value will be displayed."
  #   predicate: "full.url.for/predicate" # For creator/contributor roles, could this point to an external file where relator roles can be maintained (e.g., https://github.com/chrissyrissmeyer/metadata-ci/blob/master/lib/fields/marcrel.rb)?
